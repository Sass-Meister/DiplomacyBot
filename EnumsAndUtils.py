# This should probably be separate files
# More setters and getters for ADTs
# More __eq__'s

# Double dictionaries are used a lot in this program and maybe an ADT could be created to better use them. The two common
# uses are relatively awkward. Firstly accessing: the ability to access the inner dict w/o a key to the outer dict would
# make access more convenient. Either returning the only item if one can be found on the 2nd layer or an array if more
# than one could be found. Secondly, iteration: the for loops look awkward, if something better (returning a tuple? like
# iterating though a truth table?) could be created, iteration might be clearer. I don't particularly find construction
# to be too bad but if something better could be thought up.
